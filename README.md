# Quote Generator
This is a simple web application that generates a random quote every time the user clicks a button. The quote is displayed inside a container that has a border with an animated color and size.

## Technologies used
This project was built using the following technologies:

- [HTML]
- [CSS]
- [JavaScript]
- [Bootstrap]

## How to use

To use the application, simply open the **index.html** file in your web browser. You should see a button that says "Generate Quote". Click the button to generate a new quote. The quote will be displayed inside a container that has a border with an animated color and size.

## How it works
The quote generation is done using a JavaScript function that selects a random quote from an array of quotes. The animation of the container border is done using CSS animations.

## Future improvements
Possible future improvements for this project include:

- Adding more quotes to the array
- Allowing the user to share the quote on social media
- Adding a feature to save favorite quotes

## Credits
The quotes used in this project were taken from [Goodreads].
